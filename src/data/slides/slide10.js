The power of our system comes from rich metadata tagging:

### Document Metadata Structure
\`\`\`json
{
  "doc_type": "digest",
  "year": "1967",
  "decade": "1960s",
  "volume": "45",
  "number": "3",
  "title": "Mysteries of Sound and Music",
  "topics": ["vibration", "healing", "consciousness"]
}
\`\`\`

### 📈 Benefits of Robust Metadata

- **🔎 Precision Filtering**: Find exactly what you need
- **⏳ Temporal Analysis**: Trace concept evolution across decades
- **🔗 Cross-Reference Capability**: Connect related teachings
- **🧮 Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes
