### ðŸŽ¯ Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning

| Standard Models | ðŸŒ¿ Fine-Tuned Models |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Generic understanding of "vibration" | Recognizes "vibration" in the Rosicrucian mystical context |
| Basic comprehension of "attunement" | Deep understanding of "attunement" as a spiritual practice |
| Limited grasp of esoteric terminology | Precise comprehension of Rosicrucian terms and symbols |

### Fine-Tuning Benefits
- Better understanding of domain-specific terminology
- More accurate responses for specialized concepts
- Reduced need for extensive context in prompts
- Improved computational efficiency
