| Feature | 🔍 Semantic Search | 🔑 Keyword Search |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Mechanism | Understands meaning | Matches exact words |
| Query handling | "What is the nature of consciousness?" | "consciousness definition" |
| Synonyms | Recognizes similar concepts | Misses non-exact matches |
| Context | Considers surrounding context | Ignores relationship between words |
| Example | "Spiritual enlightenment techniques" finds "methods for mystic awakening" | Requires exact term match |

### Real-World Example

A user asks: *"How does meditation affect one's spiritual evolution?"*

- **Keyword search** finds only documents with "meditation," "affect," "spiritual," and "evolution"
- **Semantic search** also finds documents about "contemplative practices," "influence on," "mystic development," etc.
